        <h1> Video Animation</h1> Video animation is the process of creating moving images or graphics through a
        sequence of frames. It involves designing, illustrating, and animating visual elements to tell a story, explain
        a concept, or convey information in a dynamic and engaging way.
        There are various types of video animation:
        2D Animation: This type of animation involves creating movement in a two-dimensional environment. It is commonly
        used in cartoons, explainer videos, and advertisements.
        3D Animation: 3D animation creates the illusion of depth and realism by animating objects in a three-dimensional
        space. It is used in movies, video games, architectural visualization, and product demos.
        Motion Graphics: Motion graphics combine graphic design elements with animation to create visually compelling
        videos. They are often used for titles, infographics, and animated logos.
        Stop Motion: Stop motion animation involves capturing a series of still images and then playing them in sequence
        to create movement. It can be done with physical objects or using computer-generated stop motion techniques.
        Whiteboard Animation: Whiteboard animation simulates the process of drawing on a whiteboard or blackboard to
        explain complex concepts or storytelling.
        Video animation is a versatile medium used for entertainment, education, marketing, and communication. It
        requires creativity, artistic skills, and proficiency in animation software like Adobe After Effects, Autodesk
        Maya, or Blender. It has become increasingly popular in digital marketing and online content creation due to its
        ability to captivate audiences and deliver messages effectively.
