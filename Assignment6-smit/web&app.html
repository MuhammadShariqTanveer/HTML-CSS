   <h1> Web Development </h1> Creating and maintaining websites and web applications using front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) and back-end (server-side) technologies.
   <h1> App Development </h1> Building software applications for mobile devices (Android or iOS) using programming languages like Java, Kotlin, Swift, or cross-platform frameworks like React Native or Flutter.
<h1> HTML </h1> HTML is a markup language used to create the structure and content of web pages. It uses tags to define elements like headers, paragraphs, images, and links. HTML5 is the latest version, introducing new features and better semantic elements for modern web development.
<h1> CSS</h1> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a style sheet language used to control the presentation and layout of HTML documents on web pages. It enables web developers to define how elements should look, including colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS separates the content from the presentation, allowing consistent and visually appealing designs across a website.
<h1> JavaScript </h1> JavaScript is a versatile programming language used for web development. It adds interactivity and dynamic features to websites, enabling tasks like form validation, animations, and handling user interactions. As a client-side language, JavaScript runs in the user's web browser, making it essential for creating modern, interactive web applications.
