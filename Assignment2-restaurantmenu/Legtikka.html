        Leg tikka, also known as chicken leg tikka, is a delicious and popular dish made from marinated chicken legs. It is a variation of chicken tikka where specifically the chicken legs are used for their flavorful dark meat.

To prepare leg tikka, the chicken legs are first marinated in a mixture of yogurt, spices, and herbs. The marinade typically includes ingredients like cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and lemon juice, which infuse the chicken with a rich and aromatic flavor. The chicken legs are then grilled, roasted, or cooked in a tandoor (clay oven) until they are cooked through and have a slightly charred and smoky exterior.
