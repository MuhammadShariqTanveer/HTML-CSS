                    Shami kabab is a popular Pakistani and Indian dish known for its soft and melt-in-your-mouth
                    texture. It is made from a mixture of ground meat (usually beef or mutton) and lentils, along with a
                    blend of spices and herbs.

                    To prepare shami kabab, boneless meat is cooked with lentils (usually chana dal or split Bengal gram
                    lentils) until they are tender. The cooked meat and lentils are then finely minced or ground
                    together. To this mixture, a variety of spices such as ginger, garlic, red chili powder, cumin,
                    coriander, and garam masala are added, along with fresh herbs like coriander leaves and mint. Some
                    recipes may also include chopped onions or gram flour (besan) as a binding agent.
