        <h1> Artificial Intelligence </h1> AI (Artificial Intelligence) is a field of computer science that aims to
        create intelligent machines capable of performing tasks that usually require human intelligence. AI systems can
        learn from data, adapt to new inputs, and make decisions based on patterns and experiences. Some AI applications
        include natural language processing, computer vision, machine learning, robotics, and expert systems. AI has
        diverse real-world applications, ranging from virtual assistants and chatbots to autonomous vehicles and medical
        diagnosis systems.
        <h1> ChatBot</h1> Chatbot is an AI-powered computer program designed to simulate human conversation through
        natural language processing. It interacts with users through chat interfaces, like messaging apps or websites,
        providing instant responses to their inquiries or requests. Chatbots can be rule-based, following predefined
        scripts, or powered by machine learning algorithms, allowing them to learn from user interactions and improve
        their responses over time. They find applications in customer support, information retrieval, virtual
        assistants, and various other domains, streamlining communication and providing quick solutions to users'
        questions.
