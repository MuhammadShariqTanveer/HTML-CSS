                    Chana daal, also known as split Bengal gram lentils, is a popular legume in South Asian cuisine. It
                    is made from splitting and skinning the small, yellow-colored chana or Bengal gram lentils. Chana
                    daal has a nutty and earthy flavor and a firm texture, which makes it suitable for a variety of
                    dishes.

                    To prepare chana daal, it is typically soaked in water for a few hours to soften it before cooking.
                    It is then cooked with water, spices, and often with ingredients like onions, tomatoes, garlic, and
                    ginger. The lentils are simmered until they become tender and the flavors meld together. The
                    resulting dish is a thick and hearty daal with a rich, creamy consistency.
