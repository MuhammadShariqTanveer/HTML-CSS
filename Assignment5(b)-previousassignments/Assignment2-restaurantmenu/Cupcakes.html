                    Cupcakes are delightful individual-sized cakes that are enjoyed by people of all ages. They are a
                    popular treat for birthdays, parties, or simply as a sweet indulgence. Cupcakes are made from a
                    simple batter that is baked in small, paper-lined cups, giving them their distinctive shape.

                    To make cupcakes, a basic cake batter is prepared by combining ingredients such as flour, sugar,
                    butter, eggs, milk, and flavorings like vanilla extract. The ingredients are mixed together until a
                    smooth and creamy batter is formed. Variations of cupcakes can include additional ingredients such
                    as cocoa powder for chocolate flavor, fruit purees for fruity cupcakes, or spices for a touch of
                    warmth and complexity.
