                    Mutton qeema, also known as minced mutton, is a flavorful and versatile dish popular in South Asian
                    cuisine. It is made by finely chopping or grinding mutton (goat or lamb meat) into small pieces,
                    creating a textured and tender base for the dish. The qeema is then cooked with a variety of
                    aromatic spices and ingredients, such as onions, garlic, ginger, and a blend of ground spices like
                    cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder. This combination of spices adds depth and complexity
                    to the dish, infusing the mutton with a rich and savory flavor. Mutton qeema can be prepared in
                    various ways, including as a curry, kebabs, or as a filling for samosas or wraps. It is a versatile
                    ingredient that can be enjoyed as a main course, side dish, or even as a breakfast option, often
                    accompanied by rice, roti (Indian bread), or naan. Mutton qeema is a comforting and satisfying dish
                    that showcases the delicious flavors of South Asian cuisine.
