                    Mutton Karahi is a popular and flavorful dish that holds a special place in Pakistani and North
                    Indian cuisine. It is named after the cooking vessel, a karahi, which is a deep, rounded, and
                    thick-bottomed pan. This dish is known for its vibrant red color and robust flavors.

                    To prepare mutton karahi, succulent pieces of mutton are cooked in a karahi with a medley of
                    aromatic spices, including cumin, coriander, turmeric, and red chili powder. The mutton is often
                    marinated beforehand to enhance its tenderness and absorb the flavors of the spices. Freshly chopped
                    tomatoes and onions are added to the karahi, along with ginger, garlic, and green chilies, which
                    contribute to the dish's tanginess and heat.
