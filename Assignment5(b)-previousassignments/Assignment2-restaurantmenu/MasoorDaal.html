                    Masoor daal, also known as red lentils, is a popular type of lentil used in various cuisines around
                    the world. It is made from splitting and skinning red lentils, which results in a vibrant orange
                    color. Masoor daal has a mild, nutty flavor and a soft texture when cooked.

                    To prepare masoor daal, it is typically rinsed and then cooked with water or broth, along with
                    spices and aromatics like onions, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes. It is often seasoned with spices
                    such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, and chili powder, which infuse the lentils with a delicious and
                    aromatic taste. The daal is simmered until the lentils are tender and start to break down, creating
                    a thick and creamy consistency.
