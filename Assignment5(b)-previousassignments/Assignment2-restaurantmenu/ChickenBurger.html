                    A chicken burger is a mouthwatering and popular sandwich that features a juicy chicken patty nestled
                    between two burger buns. It is a delicious alternative to traditional beef burgers and offers a
                    lighter and leaner option.

                    To make a chicken burger, a chicken patty is typically made from ground or minced chicken, combined
                    with various seasonings and ingredients. These may include breadcrumbs, eggs, onions, garlic, herbs,
                    and spices like paprika, cumin, or chili powder. The mixture is shaped into patties and then cooked
                    by grilling, pan-frying, or baking until they are cooked through and golden brown.
