                    Chapati, also known as roti, is a staple flatbread in South Asian cuisines, particularly in India,
                    Pakistan, and Bangladesh. It is a simple and nutritious unleavened bread made from whole wheat
                    flour, also known as atta, and water.

                    To make chapati, the whole wheat flour is combined with water to form a dough. The dough is kneaded
                    until it becomes smooth and elastic. Small portions of the dough are then divided and rolled into
                    round, thin discs using a rolling pin. The rolled chapati is cooked on a hot griddle or tawa until
                    it puffs up and develops golden-brown spots on both sides.
