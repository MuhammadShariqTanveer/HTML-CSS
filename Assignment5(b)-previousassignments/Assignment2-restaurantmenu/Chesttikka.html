                    Chicken chest tikka refers to a variation of the popular chicken tikka dish where specifically the
                    chicken breast is used. It follows a similar process of marinating chicken breast pieces in a spiced
                    yogurt mixture and then grilling or baking them to perfection. The marinade typically consists of a
                    blend of spices, such as cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, chili powder, garlic, ginger, and
                    lemon juice. The chicken breasts are then cooked until they are tender and have a slightly charred
                    exterior, resulting in a juicy and flavorful dish. Chicken chest tikka can be enjoyed as an
                    appetizer, a protein-rich addition to salads, or as a filling in wraps and sandwiches. It offers a
                    leaner option while retaining the aromatic flavors and succulent texture of traditional chicken
                    tikka.
