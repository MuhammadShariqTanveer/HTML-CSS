                    Mutton paya, also known as goat trotters, is a traditional and hearty dish that is popular in South
                    Asian and Middle Eastern cuisines. Paya refers to the feet or trotters of the goat or lamb, and this
                    dish is made by slow-cooking the trotters in a flavorful broth until they become tender and the
                    flavors meld together.

                    To prepare mutton paya, the trotters are thoroughly cleaned and then cooked in a large pot with a
                    mixture of aromatic spices, such as cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, bay leaves, and black peppercorns.
                    Onions, garlic, ginger, and tomatoes are added to enhance the flavor further. The trotters are
                    simmered on low heat for several hours until the meat becomes tender and the bones release gelatin,
                    giving the broth a rich and thick consistency. The dish is typically seasoned with additional spices
                    like cumin, coriander, turmeric, and red chili powder to add depth of flavor.
