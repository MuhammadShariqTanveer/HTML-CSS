                    Custard is a creamy and smooth dessert that is enjoyed in many different cultures around the world.
                    It is made by combining milk or cream with sugar, eggs or cornstarch, and flavorings such as vanilla
                    or chocolate.

                    To prepare custard, the milk or cream is heated gently in a saucepan until it reaches a simmer. In a
                    separate bowl, sugar and eggs are whisked together until well combined. A portion of the hot milk or
                    cream is gradually poured into the egg mixture while continuously whisking. This step, called
                    tempering, prevents the eggs from curdling when added to the hot liquid.
